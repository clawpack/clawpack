# Clawpack Community NumFOCUS Code of Conduct

As a [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org) affiliated project we have elected to
adopt the NumFOCUS code of conduct.

## The Short Version

NumFOCUS and the Clawpack community is dedicated to providing a
harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community
members in any form.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate for NumFOCUS or Clawpack.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## Long Version

You can find the long version of the Code of Conduct on the NumFOCUS website

If you feel that the Code of Conduct has been violated, feel free to submit a
report, by using the form: [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Reporting Form](https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT?typeform-source=numfocus.org). 

## Who Will Receive Your Report
